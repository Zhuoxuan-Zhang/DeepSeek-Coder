>>> Test Cases:
assert heap_queue_largest( [25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58],3)==[85, 75, 65]

Here is my problem:
>>> Problem:
Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
>>> Test Cases:
assert remove_Occ("hello","l") == "heo"
assert remove_Occ("abcda","a") == "bcd"
assert remove_Occ("PHP","P") == "H"

Here's a Python function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string:

```python
def remove_Occ(s, char):
    first_index = s.find(char)
    last_index = s.rfind(char)
    
    if first_index == -1:
        return s  # Character not found in the string
    
    # Remove the first occurrence
    s = s[:first_index] + s[first_index+1:]
    
    # Recalculate the last index after removing the first occurrence
    last_index = s.rfind(char)
    
    if last_index == -1:
        return s  # No more occurrences found
    
    # Remove the last occurrence
    s = s[:last_index] + s[last_index+1:]
    
    return s

# Test cases
assert remove_Occ("hello", "l") == "heo"
assert remove_Occ("abcda", "a") == "bcd"
assert remove_Occ("PHP", "P") == "H"
```

This function works by first finding the index of the first occurrence of the character using `find()`. It then removes this occurrence by slicing the string. After removing the first occurrence, it recalculates the index of the last occurrence using `rfind()`. If the character is found again, it removes this last occurrence similarly by slicing the string. If the character is not found in the string, it returns the original string.

Here is my problem:
>>> Problem:
Write a function to sort a given matrix in ascending order according to the sum of its rows.
>>> Test Cases:
assert sort_matrix([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1]])==[[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]
assert sort_matrix([[1, 2, 3], [-2, 4, -5], [1, -1, 1]])==[[-2, 4, -5], [1, -1, 1], [1, 2, 3]]
assert sort_matrix([[5,8,9],[6,4,3],[2,1,4]])==[[2, 1, 4], [6, 4, 3], [5, 8, 9]]

Here's a Python function that sorts a given matrix in ascending order according to the sum of its rows, based on the examples provided:

```python
def sort_matrix(matrix):
    # Sort the matrix based on the sum of each row
    sorted_matrix = sorted(matrix, key=lambda row: sum(row))
    return sorted_matrix
```

This function uses the `sorted` function with a custom key that calculates the sum of each row. This ensures that the matrix is sorted based on the sum of its rows in ascending order.

Let's test the function with the provided test cases:

```python
assert sort_matrix([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1]]) == [[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]
assert sort_matrix([[1, 2, 3], [-2, 4, -5], [1, -1, 1]]) == [[-2, 4, -5], [1, -1, 1], [1, 2, 3]]
assert sort_matrix([[5, 8, 9], [6, 4, 3], [2, 1, 4]]) == [[2, 1, 4], [6, 4, 3], [5, 8, 9]]
```

These assertions should pass, confirming that the function works as expected.
